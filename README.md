# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs is a very important skill in software development. I have to understand the user's problem, their requirements, and the context in which the software will be used. Once information is gathered about the user's needs (through interviews, surveys, etc.) then they can be translated into functional specifications for the software that will guide the design and implementation of the software. This is the point where user stories really shine. User stories are simple, clear descriptions of the features from the user's perspective. They will help keep the focus on delivering value to the user and ensuring that the software will meet the user's needs. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I've learned through my time in the CS program that it's best to approach developing programs in an iterative, incremental manner. I start with a basic version of my program and then gradually add in features and improvements in small increments. By approaching development this way, I can receive regular feedback and incorporate any changes needed and make sure that my software is always in a working state.

Through CS-250 I learned that I really like using Scrum and Kanban frameworks. It was much easier to see the size of the tasks I needed to complete and plan accordingly. Scrum events such as daily standups and sprints are also very helpful in the development process. The Agile principles I take with me are an emphasis on adaptability, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member involves more than just technical skills. It involves active communication and collaboration. Being a good team member also means being reliable, meeting deadlines, and contributing positively to the team dynamic. It involves both giving and receiving feedback in a constructive manner to foster personal and team growth. I think that combining these skills with technical skills is what will make me a good team member on a development team.
